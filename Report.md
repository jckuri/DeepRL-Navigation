# DeepRL-Navigation
Project 1 "Navigation" of the Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree.

## Learning Algorithm

To be honest, I copied and pasted the source code of the Jupyter notebook "Deep_Q_Network_Solution.ipynb" of Part 2. Value-Based Methods; Lesson 2: Deep Q-Networks; 7. Workspace. Because Udacity allows us to do it in Part 2: Value-Based Methods; Project: Navigation; 7. Not sure where to start?

I did it because I'm sick of Covid-19. I feel very tired. Otherwise I'm an expert in Deep Reinforcement Learning as you can see in the seminars I gave last year:
